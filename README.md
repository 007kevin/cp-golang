  - [Personal Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/197mE4PGe-nwxvW_2116_JkrgclWj9eouMlQjTr3Omsg/edit#gid=155050867)
- English problems added since ABC 42
- "If you solve all problems of B and C, you would learn much and you will be much stronger."
- Important points
  1. If you cannot reach the solution, you should read editorial after 15 minutes’ thinking if problem B, and 30 minutes’ thinking if problem C.
  2. Even you can solve a problem, until you get used to code faster, there may be something to learn if you look some source codes written by high-rated coders. Recommended to look some simple source codes.
  3. Especially, when you solve problem C, I recommend you to use paper to consider.
